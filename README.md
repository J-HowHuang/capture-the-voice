# Capture THE Voice--Discord Recording Bot

## Description

This is a Discord Bot that helps you retrieve your speech in the past 30 seconds. At the moment a punchline hits, send the command, the recording will be ready for you to replay the best part of your speeches in the voice chat.

## Motivation

My friends often laugh at me when my voice crack (it happens occationally). Each time it happened, they were so eager to have a replay on it but that's not technically possible (no way I can intentionally reproduce the cracked voice).

Therefore, we got an idea to have this bot to help us record our voice, as long as it's with us in the same VC. No need to manually hit the record button or to keep useless recording with uncracked voice. All you need to do is to fire that saving command to CAPTURE THAT cRaCKeD VOICE!
